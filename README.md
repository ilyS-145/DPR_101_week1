# DPR 101 Week 1 Assigment
## This program is a facsimile of one of the programs in the textbook. (minus, of course, the images on the buttons)
## If you enter your name with a space beforehand, it displays a "good" message (customized for each option) when you click an option. If you enter it normally, (i.e. without a space) it will display a "pranked" message.
## Hope you enjoy!
